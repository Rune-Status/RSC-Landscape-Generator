# RSC-Landscape-Generator
Command line tool to generate a visual representation for every format of the RS Classic (RSC) landscape files.

## Loading
Drag landscape files into the appropriate directory for its type

For RSCD, [*input/rscd/Landscape.rscd*]

For Jag (maps28 and over), [*input/jag/maps.jag; input/jag/land.jag; input/jag/maps.mem; input/jag/land.mem*]

For Jag Legacy (maps27 and under), [*input/jag-legacy/maps.jag*]

*Note: I've already preloaded some maps for each file format*

## Running
java -jar dist/mapgen.jar [rscd|jag|jag-legacy]

### It's pretty interesting to see how the development of the rsc world progressed

*I've supplied a legacy map pack (.zip) if you're curious to test them out yourself*

### Here's an example for what this generator will produce for the RSCD file format:
